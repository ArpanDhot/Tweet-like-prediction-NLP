## 1 - Abstract

This project aims to design and implement a regression analysis model for predicting the number of likes a tweet will receive based on certain tweet characteristics. The project pipeline involves data extraction, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and manipulation, model design, feature selection, model evaluation, and data visualization.

## 2 - Introduction

This project is about analysing Twitter data to predict the popularity of a tweet based on its characteristics. The key steps in this project involve extracting a large number of tweets from various Twitter accounts, performing exploratory data analysis, cleaning the data and transforming it for regression analysis, selecting suitable predictive features, designing a regression model with the Scikit-learn package, and finally, evaluating the performance of the developed model.

## 3 - Methodology

The methodology for this project includes the following key steps:
- Data Collection: Use the Tweepy package to access the Twitter API and extract tweets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform a thorough analysis to understand the data better, aided by various visualizations.
- Data Manipulation: Clean the data and transform it into a form suitable for regression analysis.
- Regression Analysis Model: Design and implement the regression model using an appropriate method from the Scikit-learn package.
- Testing the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics and test it on new, unseen data.
- Visualisations: Present the data and results using suitable visualization techniques.
